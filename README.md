# DRF Firebase Auth

## Requirements


* Python3
* Django
* Django Rest Framework



## Installation

```
$ pip install drf-firebase-auth
```

Add the application to your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'drf_firebase_auth',
]
```

In your project's `settings.py`, add this to the `REST_FRAMEWORK` configuration. Note that if you want to retain access to the browsable API for locally created users, then you will probably want to keep `rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication` too.


```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
  ...
  'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
    ...
    'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    'drf_firebase_auth.authentication.FirebaseAuthentication',
  ]
}
```


The `drf_firebase_auth` application comes with the following settings as default, which can be overridden in your project's `settings.py` file. For convenience in version >= 1, most of these can be conveniently set form environment variables also. Make sure to nest them within `DRF_FIREBASE_AUTH` as below:


```python
DRF_FIREBASE_AUTH = {
    # allow anonymous requests without Authorization header set
    'ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_REQUESTS': os.getenv('ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_REQUESTS', False),
    # path to JSON file with firebase secrets
    'FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY':
        os.getenv('FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY', ''),
    # allow creation of new local user in db
    'FIREBASE_CREATE_LOCAL_USER':
        os.getenv('FIREBASE_CREATE_LOCAL_USER', True),
    # attempt to split firebase user.display_name and set local user
    # first_name and last_name
    'FIREBASE_ATTEMPT_CREATE_WITH_DISPLAY_NAME':
        os.getenv('FIREBASE_ATTEMPT_CREATE_WITH_DISPLAY_NAME', True),
    # commonly JWT or Bearer (e.g. JWT <token>)
    'FIREBASE_AUTH_HEADER_PREFIX':
        os.getenv('FIREBASE_AUTH_HEADER_PREFIX', 'JWT'),
    # verify that JWT has not been revoked
    'FIREBASE_CHECK_JWT_REVOKED':
        os.getenv('FIREBASE_CHECK_JWT_REVOKED', True),
    # require that firebase user.email_verified is True
    'FIREBASE_AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION':
        os.getenv('FIREBASE_AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION', False),
}
```

You can get away with leaving all the settings as default except for `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`, which is obviously required.

Now that you have configured the application, run the migrations so that the Firebase data can be stored.

```
$ ./manage.py migrate drf_firebase_auth
```

All you need to do now is have your client code handle the Firebase popup/redirect authentication flow, retrieve the idToken from the currentUser (Firebase explains this flow well in their docs: `https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens`), and then use the idToken for the user in an `Authorization` header in requests to your API.

```
JWT <token>
```

Voila!

* Please raise an issue/feature and name your branch 'feature-n' or 'issue-n', where 'n' is the issue number.
* If you test this code with a Python version not listed above and all is well, please fork and update the README to include the Python version you used :)
* I almost always setup Django with a custom user class inheriting from AbstractUser, where I switch the USERNAME_FIELD to be 'email'. This backend is setup to assign a username still anyway, but if there are any issues, please raise them and/or make a pull request to help the community!
